Salus is a health data portal that integrates health data from a
number of portable devices, usually collected by a mobile phone via
Bluetooth, and uploaded to the web. The data are captured using a
semantic framework and rendered using modules built using the
[https://github.com/ewpatton/SemantEco](SemantEco framework).

This research is actively seeking to write innovative algorithms that
can analyze health data and provide as comprehensive as possible
overview of one's health. The original use case was to help cancer
patients track the results of chemotherapy on both quantitative
(e.g. blood cell count, blood pressure, body temperature) and
qualitative (e.g. stress levels, quality of sleep) measures.

The source for the application is also used for instructive purposes
for those looking to develop SemantEco-powered applications and is
released under the MIT license. A copy of this license should
accompany the source code in the same directory as this README.
